# utilitiesapp
My utilities app, made in visual studio with Visual Basic

# Features
The current features include:

# Will this be open source?
I only plan on realeasing this program open source when I slow down development, move out of betas and start working on other apps. Then I will periodically release new updates for the program, but when development slows it will become open-source.
